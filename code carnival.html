      <h2>History</h2>
      <p id="tlOfNY">The early Roman calendar consisted of 10 months. According to the old calendar, each new year started at the vernal equinox. Romulus, the founder of rome, created the old calendar, and king Numa Pompilius was credited for adding the months Januarius and Februarius. But, the calendar fell out of sync with the sun in the passing centuries, so in 46 BC, Julius Caesar consulted the most prominent mathematicians and astronomers, and created the Julian calendar, which closely resembles the modern-day Gregorian calendar.<br><br>Julius made New Years start on January 1st to honor the god Janus. Romans celebrated by offering sacrifices to Janus, exchanging gifts with each other, decorating their homes with laurel branches and attending raucous parties. In Europe, New Years was replaced with days that had more religious significance, including December 25th and March 25th. Although, later in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII changed it back to January 1st.<br><br>Celebration often starts on the evening of December 31st, to January 1st. Some people eat various type of food in hopes of good fortune, and avoid other foods, which are believed to be bad luck. Some other customs include singing songs, or watching a fireworks display. The famous song "Auld Lang Syne" is sang in English speaking countries. The practice of making resolutions for the new year started out with the ancient Babylonians, who made certain promises to win the favor of the gods, and start the year off in the right way.</p>
